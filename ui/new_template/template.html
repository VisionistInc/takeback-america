					<em>More than 70% of those who abuse prescription pain killers get them from friends &amp; family.</em>

					The Take-Back AMERICA team calculated statistics for every county in the United States to identify where
					prescription take-back centers are available, in comparison to the prevalence of prescription opioid abuse.

				Overall risk score: <span>52%</span>

			<h3>Factors that went into this score:</h3>
			
			<h4>Vulnerability: <span>46.6%</span></h4>
			<em>A proxy for how similar the county looks to other counties with known opioid problems based on a composite of known community risk factors.</em>
			
			<h4>Normalized Mortality Rate: <span>1</span></h4>
			<em>The normalized mortality rate for this county (by census region).</em>
			
			<h4>Expected Conditions: <span>0</span></h4>
			<em>The difference between the objserved and expected mortality rate due to drug poisionings by county based on estimates provided by a multivariate model.</em>
			
			<h4>Rx Take-Back Prevalence Ratio: <span>0.017</span></h4>
			<em>Compares the availability of Rx Take-Back locations in contrast to the prevalence of opioid prescriptions among the local population (defined as opioid prescriptions per 100 population). Low values indicate a lack of Take-Back capacity in the county.</em>
